# QuaranGreen Website

QuaranGreen is a student-led Massachusetts-based nonprofit that I founded to serve my local community during the COVID-19 pandemic.  It has served over 2000 people with almost 150 volunteers in 25 cities and towns. I created this site as a centralized hub for all information, updates, and display for QuaranGreen.  It is currently hosted on www.QuaranGreen.org.
